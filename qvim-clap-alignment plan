Direct QVIM-CLAP Alignment Training Plan
1. Model Modifications
1.1 Add Projection Layer to QVIM Model

Locate the _forward_impl method in MobileNetV3 class
Add a projection layer after features extraction:
pythonself.features_projection = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(960, 512, bias=False),
    nn.LayerNorm(512)
)

Apply this in the forward method:
pythonfeatures = F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(x, (1, 1)).squeeze()
features = self.features_projection(features)
features = F.normalize(features, p=2, dim=-1)


1.2 Initialize Projection Layer

Use conservative initialization for stability
Kaiming initialization with small gain for weights
No bias parameters to maintain hypersphere geometry

All this should be made optional via an argument project_to_clap_dim (default True)

2. Training Infrastructure
2.1 Data Preparation

Ensure reference audio is processed through both QVIM and CLAP
Process imitation audio through QVIM
Create paired batches: (imitation, reference, CLAP-embedding)

2.2 Model Configuration

Use same CLAP checkpoint the AudioLDM uses by defeault.
Freeze QVIM backbone entirely
Freeze CLAP model entirely
Only train the new projection layer

2.3 Cross-Model Temperature Parameter

Add learnable temperature parameter for cross-model similarity
Initialize similar to CLAP's logit_scale (log(1/0.07))

3. Loss Functions
3.1 Define Three Similarity Objectives

QVIM Reference vs. CLAP Similarity

Primary alignment objective
Scaled by cross-model temperature


QVIM Imitation vs. QVIM Reference Similarity

Preserve QVIM's matching capability
Uses QVIM's original temperature (tau)


QVIM Imitation vs. CLAP Similarity

Direct alignment of imitations
Scaled by cross-model temperature



3.2 Combined Loss Function

Weighted combination of the three similarity losses
Progressive weighting schedule to gradually shift focus to alignment


The training process should be as similar to ex_qvim as possilbe, but making the necessary changes of course.
That includes making a new wandb project called "qvim-clap-alignment" and storing runs in an appropriately named folder.
