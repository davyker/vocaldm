1. QVIM Adapter Creation
    - We created an adapter (QVIMAdapter) that transforms 960-dimensional QVIM embeddings into 512-dimensional embeddings
  suitable for AudioLDM's conditioning mechanism
    - The adapter includes normalization and dimensionality reduction through a neural network
  2. AudioLDM Conditioning Mechanism Modification
    - We modified AudioLDM's conditioning pipeline to accept QVIM embeddings
    - Added a special conditioning key ("qvim_embedding") to bypass CLAP text processing
    - Updated the get_learned_conditioning method to handle various formats of QVIM embeddings
  3. End-to-End Pipeline Integration
    - Created the imitation_to_audio function that:
        - Takes a vocal imitation audio file as input
      - Extracts QVIM embeddings using the pre-trained QVIM model
      - Adapts these embeddings to AudioLDM's format
      - Generates classifier-free guidance unconditional embeddings
      - Uses AudioLDM's diffusion process to generate audio with these embeddings
